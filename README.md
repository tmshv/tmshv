Hi, my name is Roman. I'm a product-oriented Full-Stack Software Engineer.

My passion is new challenges. In my spare time I do open source projects.

Currently I'm working on the development of Neural Network.
The main goal of the project is to help architects and urban analysts to find popular public city spaces.
Convolutional neural network classifies data based on activity of users in social networks.

## Projects

### [Sisu service](https://unit4.io/sisu)

I developed the service that provides automation solution for architects. It automates the production of drawings. It helps architects do not waste time on routine tasks and devote it to their creative work.


### [Mesto.io](https://unit4.io/mesto)

I launched a Geo Informational System web service. This platform helps to collect opinions of citizens, analyse and visualize data. Also this is a general purpose GIS application.

### Nitka

I developed a program to help artists to transform a portrait images to String Art.
The core part of this soft is [genetic algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm) implemented from scratch.

### Yandex

As part of Yandex team I worked on an internal dashboard of Customer Support Employee.
My personal challenge was to keep code base in an up-to-date state. So my proposition was to upgrade this project to React framework and I did it.


## Education
